# Collection of tools to prepare a presentation for a Bosonization exam
Do you have a Bosonization exam approaching?
The difficulties you are facing are numerous, they are of two kinds: 
- learning and conceptualizing 
- preparing the presentation
I believe that the "preparing the presentation" part should be zero-cost. Let us do the hard work only, not waste time in preparing stuff.

## Equation editor
A graphical tool to write and save LaTeX equations in ```png``` format to be used along with LaTeX-unsupporting tools, like Google Slides. 
As you can see it was build with a big help from LLMs. What a powerful tool! 
It may well be uploaded as standalone, but maybe later.

## Exam specific scripts
- Diagonalize the kinetic part of the Hamiltonian
- Find the linearization points 
- Perform the bosonization transformation 
- Derive the mode velocities using a Bogoliubov transformation, and observe their non-analiticity
- Analyze the DSF for spin and charge sectors
